          <p>This is a basic information security awareness workshop. Learning can be through theory and practice; when theory is put into practice, there is a thin line between perfection and distortion. The workshops provide students an intensive session, which empowered students with knowledge that is inaccessible to most, in a simplified and easily graspable manner.</p>
          <p>This ethical hacking training workshop conducted by Lucideus provides students with penetration testing in various areas of the cyber world. The workshop consists of mobile security, web application security, email security, and network security. Other than hacking skills, students learned various defense techniques to secure the cyber world.</p>

          date="20th November 2014 to 22nd November 2014"
        >
          <p>This course was designed to introduce students to Embedded ‘C’. As we all know, the use of embedded systems is growing at a brisk pace, and so is the requirement for developers of these systems. To work in embedded systems, knowledge of Embedded ‘C’ and using it to develop various applications involving various interfaces is a must. Keeping this requirement in mind, a 100% hands-on exposure workshop on 8051 was organized in collaboration with SPJ. In this, we intended to impart upon students the logic of ‘C’ programming in embedded systems. Students were introduced to various interfaces commonly used in 8051 based embedded systems.</p>

          <p>This two-day workshop by ACES ACM IIT Delhi consisted of configuration on Cisco routers and switches, for which the instructor was present with their own router. A brief introduction of Cisco IOS was given to students in order to work on Cisco devices. Different routing and switching protocols concepts were learned, implemented, and used inside the network by students. Different addressing schemes were studied by students to identify systems uniquely inside the network. Students created a live network by using Cisco routers and switches and also worked on WAN and its protocols.</p>
